## Problem
First, install necessary libraries: (1) nlohmann-json for reading configuration files; (2) opencv4 for visualization.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
$ sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev
```

Second, change the parameters in the ``config.json'' file as needed. Current supported parameters include (1) the start and goal pose of the target object; (2) Poses of obstacles in the environment, (3) the length and width of a link; (4) the width and height of an obstacle/target object; (5) Clearance to obstacles.
